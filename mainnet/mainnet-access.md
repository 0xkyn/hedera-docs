# Mainnet Access

You will need a Hedera mainnet account to interact with and pay for any of the network services \(cryptocurrency, consensus, tokens, files and smart contracts\). Your Hedera account is what holds a balance of hbar to be used for transfers to other accounts or payments for network services.

Users can also create free accounts on the mainnet by visiting the [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com/) or by any of the options listed [here](https://hedera.com/account-creation).

If you choose to go through the Hedera Portal, you will have to go through the KYC process.

Your mainnet account ID will be at the top of the page in the purple box labeled “Account ID”. Make sure the mainnet drop-down is selected if your profile is associated with any testnet accounts. 

Please note that accounts on Hedera \(whether on the mainnet or testnet\) are managed using key pairs. In order for the Hedera Wallet and most applications to successfully interact with the network, a user needs to have the correct account ID matched with the correct key pair.
