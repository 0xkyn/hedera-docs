# Mainnet Access

You will need a Hedera mainnet account to interact with and pay for any of the network services (cryptocurrency, consensus, tokens, files and smart contracts). Your Hedera account is what holds a balance of hbar to be used for transfers to other accounts or payments for network services.

Create free mainnet accounts by visiting any of these wallet providers:

<table><thead><tr><th>Wallet</th><th data-type="checkbox">Private Key Viewable</th><th>Recovery Phrase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://support.atomicwallet.io/article/19-how-to-view-your-private-keys-backup-phrase">Atomic </a></td><td>true</td><td>none</td></tr><tr><td>Coinomi</td><td>false</td><td>24 word recovery phrase</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.exodus.com/hedera-wallet-hbar">Exodus</a></td><td>true</td><td>none</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://guarda.com/coins/hedera-wallet/">Guarda</a></td><td>true</td><td>none</td></tr><tr><td>Xact</td><td>true</td><td>24 word recovery phrase</td></tr><tr><td>Wallawallet</td><td>true</td><td>24 word recovery phrase</td></tr></tbody></table>



You can also go through the Hedera developer portal to create mainnet accounts. If you choose to go through the portal, you will have to complete the KYC process. &#x20;

Your mainnet account ID will be at the top of the page in the purple box labeled “Account ID”. Make sure the mainnet drop-down is selected if your profile is associated with any testnet accounts.&#x20;

Please note that accounts on Hedera (whether on the mainnet or testnet) are managed using key pairs. In order for the Hedera Wallet and most applications to successfully interact with the network, a user needs to have the correct account ID matched with the correct key pair.
