# Hedera Service Integration with Smart Contracts

The Hedera Service integration with Hedera Smart Contract Service allows you to interact with Hedera transactions directly in your Solidity contract. This is made possible by importing the supporting Solidity libraries into your contract and makes interacting with the other Hedera Services as seamless as possible.

The Hedera Service integration currently supports the Hedera Token Service transactions where you can interact with tokens on the Hedera network directly from your contract. The Hedera Token Service integration support token associate, dissociate, mint, burn and transfer.

Stay tuned for future releases that will expand support for the remaining HTS transactions!
